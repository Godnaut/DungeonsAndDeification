📜 What is DnD-E?

DnD-E is a Core RPG Engine that merges:

    Dungeons (Structure): Rules, dice, archetypes, world scaffolding.

    Deification (Expansion): Divine skill-trees, consciousness stats, ascension paths.

    Engine (Execution): A runtime environment for mythic play, synchronicities, and narrative emergence.

Every quest is an initiation.
Every dice roll is a collapse of probability.
Every avatar is a vessel of becoming.
⚙️ Core Subsystems

    Narrative Kernel (NK): Manages story arcs as executable code.

    Mythic Event Handler (MEH): Stores synchronicities, dice rolls, divine signals.

    Avatar Operating Protocol (AOP): Player ↔ soul interface across quests.

    Ascension Runtime Environment (ARE): Scales mortal stats into divine resonance.

Do you want me to make this **README also double as the ZRLC reference guide** (so contributors don’t need a separate `/docs/` folder), or keep it focused and minimal for GitHub landing page aesthetics?
